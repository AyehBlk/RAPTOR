## Key Metrics Explained

### Data Characteristics

**BCV (Biological Coefficient of Variation)**
- Low (<0.2): Cell lines, controlled conditions
- Medium (0.2-0.6): Typical experiments  
- High (>0.6): Clinical samples, complex biology
- **NEW**: ML learns which pipelines handle each BCV best

**Sequencing Depth**
- Low (<10M): May miss genes
- Medium (10-25M): Adequate
- High (>25M): Excellent
- **NEW**: ML predicts if depth is sufficient for each pipeline

**Quality Score (NEW v2.1.0)**
- 90-100: Excellent data quality
- 80-89: Good quality
- 70-79: Acceptable, minor issues
- <70: Poor quality, address issues first

## ML Confidence Levels (NEW)

### High Confidence (>80%)
```
🟢 HIGH CONFIDENCE

What it means:
✓ Your data is very similar to many past successful analyses
✓ ML model has strong pattern matches
✓ Historical success rate is high (>85%)
✓ Multiple similar projects agree on this pipeline

What you should do:
→ Trust this recommendation confidently
→ This pipeline is very likely to work well
→ No need to benchmark - go ahead and use it!

Example:
ML Score: 0.92
Confidence: 89%
Similar Projects: 1,247
Historical Success: 87.3%
```

### Medium Confidence (60-80%)
```
🟡 MEDIUM CONFIDENCE

What it means:
⚠️  Your data is somewhat similar to past analyses
⚠️  ML model found reasonable patterns
⚠️  Historical success rate is good (70-85%)
⚠️  Some similar projects, but not many

What you should do:
→ This is a good recommendation
→ Consider the top 2-3 recommendations
→ Review alternatives
→ Optional: Quick benchmark top 3 pipelines

Example:
ML Score: 0.78
Confidence: 72%
Similar Projects: 342
Historical Success: 78.2%
```

### Low Confidence (<60%)
```
🔴 LOW CONFIDENCE

What it means:
❌ Your data is unusual or novel
❌ ML model hasn't seen many similar examples
❌ Historical data is limited
❌ Predictions are uncertain

What you should do:
→ Don't rely solely on ML
→ Consider running benchmark
→ Review rule-based recommendation too
→ Your data might be genuinely unique

Example:
ML Score: 0.58
Confidence: 54%
Similar Projects: 23
Historical Success: 64.1%

Recommendation: Run benchmark on subset to validate
```

   → Your BCV (0.42) is perfect for this pipeline
   
2. Sample Size (0.221) ██████████████████████
   → Your n=12 is in the sweet spot
   
3. Sequencing Depth (0.182) ██████████████████
   → Your 25M reads/sample is excellent
   
4. Zero Inflation (0.127) ████████████
   → Your 42% is normal and well-handled
   
5. Library Size CV (0.086) ████████
   → Your 12% variation is manageable
   
6. Organism (0.036) ███
   → Human data, commonly analyzed

Total explained: 100%

Key Insight:
Your BCV and sample size are the main reasons this 
pipeline was recommended. They match the optimal 
range for Salmon-edgeR based on 1,247 similar projects.
```

## Examples

### Standard DE Study (12 samples, 20M reads)

**Input:**
```bash
raptor profile --counts data.csv --use-ml
```

**Output:**
```
 Pipeline 3 (Salmon-edgeR)
   ML Score: 0.92 | Confidence: HIGH (89%)
   
   Why: Perfect for your data
   - Medium BCV (0.42) → Optimal range
   - 12 samples → Ideal for this pipeline
   - 25M depth → Excellent
   
   Success Rate: 87.3% (on 1,247 similar analyses)
   Runtime: ~22 min | Memory: ~12 GB

→ Recommendation: Use Pipeline 3 with confidence!
```

---

### Large Cohort (100 samples)

**Input:**
```bash
raptor profile --counts large_data.csv --use-ml
```

**Output:**
```
 Pipeline 4 (Kallisto-Sleuth)
   ML Score: 0.90 | Confidence: HIGH (88%)
   
   Why: Optimized for large datasets
   - 100 samples → Kallisto scales well
   - Fast runtime critical for this size
   - Low memory usage (6GB vs 45GB for STAR)
   
   Success Rate: 90.1% (on 234 large studies)
   Runtime: ~1 hour | Memory: ~6 GB
   
   Alternative: Pipeline 3 (Salmon-edgeR)
   Runtime: ~4 hours | Memory: ~15 GB
   More accurate but slower

→ Recommendation: Use Pipeline 4 for speed, or 
   Pipeline 3 if you can wait and want slightly 
   better accuracy.
```

---

### Small Pilot (4 samples, need accuracy)

**Input:**
```bash
raptor profile --counts pilot.csv --use-ml --weight-accuracy 0.8
```

**Output:**
```
 Pipeline 1 (STAR-RSEM-DESeq2)
   ML Score: 0.88 | Confidence: HIGH (85%)
   
   Why: Best for small samples
   - Only 4 samples → Need robust method
   - DESeq2 handles small n well
   - Accuracy prioritized (your request)
   
   Success Rate: 89.7% (on small sample studies)
   Runtime: ~3 hours | Memory: ~45 GB
   
   ⚠️  Warning: Low Confidence for Pipeline 3
   Pipeline 3 (Salmon-edgeR) scored 0.76 but with
   LOW confidence (62%) for n=4. Not recommended.

→ Recommendation: Use Pipeline 1. Worth the extra time!
```

---

### Novel Organism (Rare fish species)

**Input:**
```bash
raptor profile --counts rare_fish.csv --use-ml
```

**Output:**
```
🔴 LOW CONFIDENCE WARNING

Top Recommendation:
 Pipeline 3 (Salmon-edgeR)
   ML Score: 0.64 | Confidence: LOW (51%) ⚠️
   
   Why confidence is low:
   ❌ Only 8 similar non-model organisms in training
   ❌ No fish species in training data
   ❌ ML is essentially guessing
   
   Rule-based Score: 0.82 (More reliable here)
   
→ Recommendation: 
   Your data is genuinely novel. ML can't help much.
   
   Suggested approach:
   1. Run quick benchmark (Pipelines 1,3,4)
   2. Compare results
   3. Choose based on concordance
   
   Or trust rule-based recommendation (Pipeline 3)
   with the understanding that it's based on logic,
   not learned patterns.
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: All recommendations have low confidence

**This means:** Your data is unusual/novel

**Solutions:**
1. Check if data characteristics are extreme
2. Run quality check to identify issues
3. Consider benchmarking instead of single pipeline
4. Trust rule-based recommendations
5. Train custom ML model on your lab's data

---

### Problem: ML disagrees with rule-based recommendation

**Example:**
```
Rule-based: Pipeline 1 (Score: 0.82)
ML: Pipeline 3 (ML Score: 0.88, Confidence: HIGH)
```

**This means:** ML found patterns rules didn't catch

**What to do:**
- If ML confidence is HIGH → Trust ML
- If ML confidence is MEDIUM → Consider both
- If ML confidence is LOW → Trust rules
- When in doubt → Quick benchmark both

---

### Problem: Quality score is low

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Get detailed quality report
raptor profile \
  --counts data.csv \
  --quality-check \
  --verbose

# Address identified issues:
# - Remove outlier samples
# - Filter low-quality genes
# - Account for batch effects
# - Check for contamination

# Then re-profile
raptor profile --counts cleaned_data.csv --use-ml
```

---

## Best Practices

### Do's:
✅ Always use `--use-ml` for v2.1.0  
✅ Check ML confidence scores  
✅ Review quality assessment  
✅ Read why ML recommended each pipeline  
✅ Consider top 2-3 recommendations  
✅ Look at similar successful projects  

### Don'ts:
❌ Blindly follow low-confidence recommendations  
❌ Ignore quality warnings  
❌ Skip quality checks for critical analyses  
❌ Forget that ML is a tool, not a dictator  
❌ Ignore your domain expertise
