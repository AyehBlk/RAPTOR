## What is RAPTOR?

**RAPTOR** is an open-source Python framework that covers the full RNA-seq analysis workflow — from finding and downloading datasets, through quality assessment and differential expression, to ensemble analysis and biomarker discovery.

It's built for researchers who want to spend time on biology, not on figuring out which pipeline to use, what thresholds to set, or how to combine results from different tools. Everything runs from a visual dashboard or the command line.

**What you get:**

- Search and download RNA-seq datasets from GEO, SRA, TCGA, and ArrayExpress directly from a visual dashboard — no coding required. GEO and SRA are fully functional; TCGA and ArrayExpress are under active development.
- Upload your own count matrices and work interactively with sample metadata — add columns, rename groups, exclude samples, assign batches. Then pool multiple studies into one dataset with automatic gene ID harmonization and batch correction. RAPTOR checks whether your datasets are actually poolable and flags problems like library size differences, low gene overlap, or batch effects before you proceed.
- Profile your data across 32 features (BCV, dispersion, sparsity, sample balance, and more) and get pipeline recommendations. RAPTOR offers two recommendation modes: an ML-based approach using a Random Forest classifier, and a rule-based approach for simpler guidance.
- Run differential expression with DESeq2, edgeR, and limma, then combine results into a consensus through ensemble analysis. Five combination methods (Fisher's, Brown's, RRA, Voting, Weighted) reduce false positives by about 33% compared to any single method.
- Optimize your significance thresholds using data-driven methods instead of arbitrary cutoffs. Four approaches available: Ground Truth (calibrate against known DE genes if you have them), FDR Control, Stability (consistent across subsamples), and Reproducibility (replicates across datasets). Works with or without prior data, but prior data like ground truth gives better calibration.
- Validate your findings across independent cohorts for robust biomarker candidates. Module 10 (Biomarker Discovery, under development — target mid-April 2026) will support multiple discovery scenarios: single-cohort candidate identification, cross-cohort validation by pooling your data with public studies, consistency ranking across studies, effect size filtering, and pathway enrichment analysis. The goal is to surface biomarker candidates that are not just statistically significant in one experiment, but reproducible across independent datasets from different labs and patient populations.

## Modules

Everything below is accessible through a visual dashboard — no coding required. 10 pages covering the full workflow from data acquisition to visualization. Launch with `python -m streamlit run raptor/dashboard/app.py`.

### Data Acquisition (Module 6b)

Your analysis starts with data. RAPTOR connects to public repositories so you can search, preview, and download RNA-seq datasets without leaving the dashboard.

| Repository | Status | What you get |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| **GEO** (NCBI) | Ready | Search 200,000+ datasets, download processed count matrices |
| **SRA** (NCBI) | Ready | Explore run tables, auto-detect linked GEO studies, generate FASTQ download commands |
| **TCGA** (NCI) | In development | 33 cancer types via GDC API |
| **ArrayExpress** (EBI) | In development | European studies via BioStudies API |

You can also upload your own count matrix — from your own experiment or from collaborators at your institute. RAPTOR treats uploaded data the same way as public data.

**Interactive metadata editing:** Before pooling, you can work directly with sample metadata in the dashboard. Add new columns (condition, timepoint, tissue), rename groups, assign batch labels, exclude samples you don't want to include — all from a visual table editor with color-coded datasets.

**Dataset pooling:** Select 2 or more datasets and RAPTOR merges them into one. It harmonizes gene IDs across studies (Ensembl, Symbol, Entrez via MyGene.info), applies batch correction (ComBat, quantile normalization, or median ratio), and runs statistical checks to tell you whether the datasets are actually reliable enough to pool. If they're not, it flags the problems — library size differences, low gene overlap, batch clustering in PCA — and suggests how to fix them.

This is the foundation for cross-cohort biomarker validation — a gene that is consistently differentially expressed across your data and independent public cohorts is a far more credible biomarker candidate than one found in a single study.

### Quality Assessment (Module 2)

Six outlier detection methods with consensus-based reporting. Detects batch effects, library size issues, and sample quality problems. Gives you actionable recommendations — not just flags.

### Data Profiling (Module 3)

Extracts 32 features from your dataset: BCV, sample balance, dispersion patterns, sparsity, and more. These features feed into the ML recommender to help you choose the right pipeline.

### Pipeline Recommender (Module 4)

A Random Forest classifier trained on dataset features tells you which quantification pipeline to use and how confident it is. Also provides rule-based recommendations as a simpler alternative.

### Production Pipelines (Module 5)

Six quantification pipelines, all supporting paired-end and single-end reads:

| Pipeline | Speed | Memory | Best for |
|----------|-------|--------|----------|
| Salmon | Fast | 8 GB | Standard DE analysis (recommended) |
| Kallisto | Fastest | 4 GB | Speed priority |
| STAR + featureCounts | Moderate | 32 GB | Gene-level publication |
| STAR + RSEM | Slow | 32 GB | Isoform analysis |
| STAR + Salmon | Moderate | 32 GB | BAM + bootstraps |
| HISAT2 + featureCounts | Moderate | 16 GB | Lower memory systems |

### Differential Expression (Module 6 + Module 7)

Python wrappers for R-based DE analysis (DESeq2, edgeR, limma). Module 7 imports and standardizes results from any DE tool into a common format for downstream analysis.

### Parameter Optimization (Module 8)

Four methods for finding optimal thresholds instead of using arbitrary cutoffs:

- **Ground Truth** — when you have known DE genes to calibrate against
- **FDR Control** — data-driven FDR threshold selection
- **Stability** — thresholds that give consistent results across subsamples
- **Reproducibility** — thresholds that replicate across independent datasets

### Ensemble Analysis (Module 9)

Combine results from DESeq2, edgeR, and limma into a single consensus. Five statistical methods: Fisher's, Brown's (accounts for method correlation), Robust Rank Aggregation, Voting, and Weighted Ensemble. Reduces false positives by about 33% compared to any single method.

### Biomarker Discovery (Module 10)

Under development — target mid-April 2026. This module consumes pooled datasets from Module 6b and applies multiple discovery strategies depending on your research scenario:

- **Single-cohort discovery** — identify candidate biomarkers from your own study using differential expression, effect size filtering, and statistical confidence
- **Cross-cohort validation** — pool your data with 2-3 public studies of the same condition and find genes that are consistently differentially expressed across all cohorts
- **Consistency ranking** — rank candidates by how reproducible they are across independent datasets, not just by p-value in a single experiment
- **Effect size filtering** — prioritize candidates with biologically meaningful fold changes, not just statistically significant ones
- **Pathway enrichment** — connect individual gene candidates to biological pathways and functional categories

The key idea: a biomarker that survives batch correction and remains significant across 3+ independent cohorts from different labs and patient populations is far more credible than one found in a single study. RAPTOR's Data Acquisition and Pooling modules make this cross-cohort workflow accessible without custom integration code.

edger = import_de_result('edger_results.csv', method='edger')
limma = import_de_result('limma_results.csv', method='limma')

# Try multiple ensemble methods
results = {}

# Fisher's Method (classic)
results['fisher'] = ensemble_fisher({'deseq2': deseq2, 'edger': edger, 'limma': limma})

# Brown's Method (recommended - accounts for correlation)
results['brown'] = ensemble_brown({'deseq2': deseq2, 'edger': edger, 'limma': limma})

# Robust Rank Aggregation
results['rra'] = ensemble_rra({'deseq2': deseq2, 'edger': edger, 'limma': limma})

# Compare results
for method, result in results.items():
    print(f"{method}: {len(result.consensus_genes)} consensus genes")

# Use Brown's method (best for correlated methods)
final_result = results['brown']
final_result.to_csv('final_consensus.csv')
```

### Example 3: CLI Workflow

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Complete RAPTOR workflow using CLI

# Step 1: QC
raptor qc --counts counts.csv --metadata metadata.csv --output qc_results/

# Step 2: Profile
raptor profile --counts counts.csv --metadata metadata.csv --group-column condition

# Step 3: Recommend
raptor recommend --profile profile.json --method ml

# Step 4: Import DE results
raptor import-de --input deseq2_results.csv --method deseq2 --output imported/
raptor import-de --input edger_results.csv --method edger --output imported/
raptor import-de --input limma_results.csv --method limma --output imported/

# Step 5: Optimize thresholds (NEW!)
raptor optimize --de-result imported/deseq2.csv --method fdr-control --fdr-target 0.05

# Step 6: Ensemble analysis (NEW!)
raptor ensemble-compare \
    --deseq2 imported/deseq2.csv \
    --edger imported/edger.csv \
    --limma imported/limma.csv \
    --output ensemble_results/

echo "✅ Complete! Check ensemble_results/ for consensus genes."

## Known Issues & Troubleshooting

### v2.2.2 Known Issues

| Issue | Status | Workaround |
|-------|--------|------------|
| `raptor dashboard` CLI command fails with `ModuleNotFoundError` | Fix planned | Use `python -m streamlit run raptor/dashboard/app.py` |
| TCGA connector incomplete | In development | Use GEO for processed counts |
| ArrayExpress connector incomplete | In development | Use GEO as alternative |
| PyPI version is still 2.2.1 | By design | Install from GitHub for v2.2.2 (see below) |
| ML Recommender requires pre-trained model file | By design | Use rule-based recommender (`--method rule`) |

### Install v2.2.2 from GitHub

PyPI will be updated after all modules are complete and tested. For now:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AyehBlk/RAPTOR.git
cd RAPTOR
python -m venv .venv

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -e .
pip install streamlit GEOparse biopython mygene
python -m streamlit run raptor/dashboard/app.py
```

### Common Errors

<details>
<summary><strong>"streamlit: not recognized" or "command not found"</strong></summary>

Streamlit is not installed or not on your PATH.

```bash
# Fix: install with dashboard extras
pip install raptor-rnaseq[dashboard]

# Or install streamlit directly
pip install streamlit

# If using a virtual environment, make sure it's activated first
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\Activate
# Linux/macOS: source .venv/bin/activate
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'raptor'"</strong></summary>

This can happen when running `raptor dashboard` from the CLI.

```bash
# Workaround: run streamlit directly
python -m streamlit run raptor/dashboard/app.py
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"raptor --version" shows wrong version</strong></summary>

If you installed from PyPI, it will show 2.2.1 (the latest PyPI release). For v2.2.2, install from GitHub.

```bash
# Check the version
python -c "import raptor; print(raptor.__version__)"
# Should print: 2.2.2 (GitHub) or 2.2.1 (PyPI)
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Dashboard pages show errors with no data loaded</strong></summary>

The dashboard requires data to be uploaded or loaded into session state before most pages will work. Start by:

1. Go to the **Quality Assessment** page and upload a count matrix CSV and metadata CSV
2. Or go to **Import DE** and upload DESeq2/edgeR/limma result files
3. Pages will populate once data is available in the session
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Import errors on Windows (path issues)</strong></summary>

If you see path-related errors on Windows:

```bash
# Make sure you're not inside a folder named 'raptor' — this shadows the package
cd C:\Users\YourName
python -c "import raptor; print(raptor.__version__)"

# If using the source code, install in editable mode
cd C:\path\to\RAPTOR
pip install -e .
```
</details>
