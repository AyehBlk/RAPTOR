title: "RAPTOR: RNA-seq Analysis Pipeline Testing and Optimization Resource"
abstract: >-
  RAPTOR is a comprehensive framework for benchmarking and optimizing RNA-seq 
  differential expression analysis pipelines. It provides ML-powered pipeline 
  recommendations, adaptive threshold optimization, interactive dashboards, 
  ensemble analysis, and automated reporting to make pipeline selection 
  evidence-based rather than guesswork.
